# 📈 Portfolio Optimization & CAPM Analysis of Canadian Stocks

This project was completed as part of a **Finance course at Concordia University**. It demonstrates portfolio optimization using the Markowitz model and evaluates the CAPM for a selection of Canadian stocks using Excel.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📊 Build an optimal portfolio of five Canadian stocks based on weekly returns (Feb 19, 2024 – Feb 10, 2025).
- 📉 Calculate risk (covariance matrix) and expected returns.
- ⚖️ Determine portfolio weights including a risk-free asset for a risk-averse investor.
- 📈 Compute portfolio performance metrics such as expected return and Sharpe ratio.
- 📉 Estimate stock betas against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (market portfolio).
- 🔍 Test the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) validity using regression analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Data

- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance for historical stock prices and market index.
- **Timeframe:** Weekly adjusted close prices, one year.
- **Software:** Microsoft Excel with Analysis ToolPak enabled for regressions.

### Assumptions

- Risk-free rate assumed at 2.8% annually.
- Investor’s coefficient of risk aversion assumed to be 3

## 🔍 Methodology

### Part 1: Portfolio Optimization

- Selected 5 Canadian stocks.
- Calculated weekly returns, mean returns, and covariance matrix.
- Applied Markowitz portfolio theory with risk aversion coefficient.
- Included a risk-free asset (annual rate: 2.8%).
- Calculated expected return and Sharpe ratio for the optimal portfolio.
- Compared with an equally weighted portfolio.

### Part 2: Beta Estimation & CAPM Testing

- Used S&P/TSX Composite Index as the market portfolio.
- Performed regressions of stock returns on market returns to estimate beta.
- Tested CAPM by regressing average returns against betas.
- Analyzed regression results (R-squared, intercept, slope) for model validity.
